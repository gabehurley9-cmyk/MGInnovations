        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
            At M&G Innovations, our mission is to push the boundaries of student-led engineering through innovative
            propulsion research and hands-on development. We focus on creating exciting, high-performing projects
            that combine speed, precision, and creativity. By exploring advanced ignition systems and experimental
            hardware, we aim to make cutting-edge engineering approachable and engaging for young engineers everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every rocket and experimental device we develop begins with detailed planning and CAD design, allowing us
            to engineer efficient, reliable, and reproducible systems. This process ensures that our projects are
            not only exciting to build and operate but also accessible, safe, and educational. We take pride in
            making engineering a playful and inspiring experience, where creativity meets technical skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the mechanics, our work emphasizes experimentation, iteration, and learning through trial and error.
            By testing our propulsion systems and refining our designs, we cultivate a culture of curiosity and problem-solving
            that extends far beyond the backyard or classroom. Each project is a chance to innovate, explore new concepts,
            and bring ideas to life in tangible, thrilling ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, our mission is to empower student engineers to explore their interests, develop practical skills,
            and experience the excitement of creating something from concept to launch. Through our work, we hope to
            inspire a new generation of engineers who are bold, resourceful, and unafraid to experiment in the pursuit
            of fun, fast, and accessible engineering.
        </p>
