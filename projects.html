        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>
            We design propulsion systems, engine prototypes, custom ignition modules,
            testing rigs, and experimental engineering hardware. Each project is fully
            student-built with a focus on innovation and reliability.
        </p>

        <h2>Pulse Jet Engine</h2>
        <p>
            We design and build compact pulse jet engines, experimenting with fuel efficiency, thrust,
            and noise optimization. These engines allow us to study pulse combustion and explore
            lightweight propulsion technologies for model rockets and other experimental devices.
        </p>

        <h2>Rocket Nozzles</h2>
        <p>
            Our team designs and fabricates custom rocket nozzles using CAD software and precise manufacturing.
            By testing different nozzle shapes and sizes, we improve thrust, fuel efficiency, and overall
            rocket performance in a controlled, educational environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Rockets</h2>
        <p>
            From backyard models to more complex experimental rockets, we develop vehicles that demonstrate
            real-world principles of aerodynamics, propulsion, and structural design. Safety and accessibility
            are a priority in all our rocket projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Rocket Engines</h2>
        <p>
            We construct and test small-scale rocket engines to understand thrust, combustion efficiency,
            and material performance under high temperatures. Our experiments give hands-on insight into
            the engineering behind full-scale propulsion systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Cannons</h2>
        <p>
            To study pressure dynamics and projectile motion, we build and test small cannons for experimental
            purposes. These projects help us learn about safety, materials engineering, and controlled energy
            release in mechanical systems.
