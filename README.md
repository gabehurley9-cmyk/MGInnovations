        <h1>M&G Innovations</h1>
        <p>
           Hey it's Gabe, the founder of this small organization. This isn't really too serious, M&G Innovations is just
            and my friends messing around, having fun, learning, and making cool things. We aim to improve our designs
            and skills, bringing them to the next level.
                Every launch, burn, shot, is us having fun, not just as engineers, but as friends enjoying life. We aim
            to make fun things and constantly improve our designs. We love basically all things engineering, and fire.
            Bringing many things to the table.
                We'd love if any of you would like to join us in our adventure through engineering. We may not be the
            best, but we have the passion, and love for out craft. We build the skill and love together, sharing ideas
            to further the strengths of our builds and experiments.
                Ultimately, our true mission is to empower engineering in people who don't see it as something easy to
            do spread creativity, and make the world a better and smarter place. Our other goals are having fun and
            making cool things for us and other to enjoy, we hope to hear from you if you're interested in joining!
                                                                                                Sincerely, Gabriel
        </p>
