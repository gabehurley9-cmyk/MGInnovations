        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            M&G Innovations is a student-led engineering group based in Indiana, founded by two passionate
            young inventors, Gabriel and Max. Our projects range from experimental hardware
            to high-speed rockets, always designed to be affordable and accessible for everyone.
        </p>

            <h2>About the Company</h2>
            <p>
                At M&G Innovations, our focus is designing and developing fun, accessible rockets and experimental
                hardware. Every project starts with careful planning and CAD design, which allows us to build
                precise, efficient, and easily reproducible prototypes. By using CAD and modern design tools, we
                can ensure our rockets are not only high-performing but also safe and easy to assemble for anyone
                interested in hands-on engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe science and engineering should be approachable and fun. From initial sketches to launching
                our rockets in the backyard, we combine creativity, technical skill, and experimentation to make
                projects that are both educational and exciting. Our goal is to inspire others to explore engineering
                and create their own fast, affordable, and fun inventions.
            </p>

            <h2>Founders</h2>
            <p>
                Gabriel and Max, both 14, are the creative force behind M&G Innovations. From tinkering with
                small machines to launching miniature rockets in backyards, their curiosity and ingenuity
                have been the driving force of the group. They thrive on turning simple, inexpensive ideas
                into thrilling, hands-on projects that capture the excitement of science and engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up in Indiana, they bonded over their shared love for problem-solving, technology, and
                fun experiments. Their hobbies include video games, YouTube tinkering videos, and music,
                which all influence their inventive approach to building new projects. Gabriel and Max are not
                just engineers in training — they are creative adventurers, constantly exploring new ways to
                make science exciting, playful, and accessible.
